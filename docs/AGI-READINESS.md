# AGI Readiness

Apex Digital is designed to seamlessly integrate with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) when they become available.

## Principles

- **Abstraction**: All AI interactions go through adapters; swapping in an AGI requires only changing a config value.
- **Data Collection**: The platform collects vast datasets (design preferences, campaign results, user behavior) that can be used to train or fine‑tune AGI models.
- **Autonomous Decision‑Making**: The AI Target Engine and Marketing Studio already use rule‑based optimization; these can be upgraded to AGI‑driven strategic planning.
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes and microservices allow adding new AI capabilities without downtime.

## Migration Path

1. Replace `openaiService.js` with `agiService.js` that calls the AGI API.
2. Update prompts to leverage AGI's reasoning capabilities.
3. Enable self‑improvement: let AGI modify its own prompts and strategies based on outcomes.
4. Integrate with external AGI providers (e.g., OpenAI's future AGI, DeepMind, etc.).
